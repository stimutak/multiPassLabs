# Terminal Transformation Requirements

## Introduction

Transform MultiPass Labs from its current gradient-based design to a dark, glitchy terminal aesthetic that establishes the platform as an experimental collective operated by 10 mysterious lab entities. The transformation should create an immersive experience that showcases audio-reactive visuals and generative art experiments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Terminal Boot Sequence

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to experience an immersive terminal boot sequence when I first visit the site, so that I understand the mysterious lab collective atmosphere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen terminal boot sequence
2. WHEN the boot sequence starts THEN the system SHALL show a pure black background (#000000) with green phosphor text (#00ff00)
3. WHEN the boot sequence progresses THEN the system SHALL display four phases: Boot, System checks, ASCII logo reveal, and Ready message
4. WHEN the ASCII logo is displayed THEN the system SHALL show "Press any key to continue..." prompt
5. WHEN the user presses any key THEN the system SHALL transition to the main site with "WELCOME - Entering the multiverse..." message
6. WHEN the boot sequence is active THEN the system SHALL include optional Richard Devine-inspired glitch audio that can be toggled

### Requirement 2: Lab Entity System

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want posts and gallery items to be attributed to mysterious lab entities, so that the collective nature of the platform is established.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new content THEN the system SHALL randomly assign one of 10 lab entities as the author
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL show the entity signature (e.g., "[nU11.form] v0.3a")
3. WHEN showing entity attribution THEN the system SHALL use the entity's specific accent color for highlights
4. WHEN editing content THEN the system SHALL allow manual override of entity assignment
5. WHEN an entity is assigned THEN the system SHALL store the entityId in the database
6. WHEN displaying entity signatures THEN the system SHALL include version tags like [sig/3.3] in metadata

### Requirement 3: Dark Terminal Visual Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the entire site to have a consistent dark terminal aesthetic, so that the experimental lab atmosphere is maintained throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL use pure black backgrounds (#000000) instead of gradients
2. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use monospace/terminal fonts as primary typography
3. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL include subtle scanline and CRT effects
4. WHEN hovering over elements THEN the system SHALL apply glitch effects
5. WHEN displaying the site THEN the system SHALL include a Matrix rain effect in the background at 10% opacity
6. WHEN using colors THEN the system SHALL prioritize green phosphor (#00ff00) and entity-specific accent colors

### Requirement 4: Entity Data Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want lab entity data to be properly structured and managed, so that entity attribution works consistently across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load entity definitions from lib/entities.ts
2. WHEN storing entity data THEN the system SHALL include name, signature, color, and role for each entity
3. WHEN assigning entities THEN the system SHALL support both random assignment and manual selection
4. WHEN displaying entities THEN the system SHALL use consistent color coding throughout the interface
5. WHEN managing entities THEN the system SHALL maintain the 10 predefined entities: nU11.form, drex:0m, noize.p4th, x3n0.form, ƒ1lament, 5ub.signal, 1r1s.fade, ctrlN0!r, NØD3//STATE, mu1ti.p@ss

### Requirement 5: Audio System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want optional glitch audio that enhances the terminal experience, so that the platform feels more immersive and experimental.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the boot sequence plays THEN the system SHALL offer optional Richard Devine-inspired glitch audio
2. WHEN audio is enabled THEN the system SHALL use Web Audio API for sound generation
3. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide an audio toggle option
4. WHEN audio is disabled THEN the system SHALL remember the user's preference
5. WHEN audio plays THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility across modern browsers
6. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL create glitch effects that complement the visual design

### Requirement 6: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the terminal aesthetic to remain accessible and performant, so that I can use the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for all terminal elements
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL maintain full keyboard accessibility
3. WHEN loading the site THEN the system SHALL achieve target load time of under 2 seconds
4. WHEN displaying effects THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. WHEN using the terminal interface THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for readability
6. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the terminal experience appropriately
